A collection of scripts to make Skyrim Together run on Linux

# WORK IN PROGRESS!
**This installation script does not include installing Steam so Steam versions of the game might not launch!**

### Installation (Lutris)
Run the installation script with the following command:
```
lutris -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santeri3700/skyrim-together-linux/master/skyrim-together.json
```

You might need to copy/move your settings and saves to `$HOME/Documents/My Games/Skyrim...`

To change the settings for Skyrim, you must choose "Run EXE inside wine prefix" and select the Skyrim launcher executable.
